# Climate-Change-Study
This notebook is a project I worked on with a peer.
Our objective was to create a tool that demonstrated the impacts and effects of climate change through a variety of different mediums.
It features interactive charts showing correlations between living conditions and their impacts on happiness and wellbeing in different countries.
It also has graphs and charts detailing the correlation between carbon emisions and rainfall/temperature changes in a variety of countries around the world.

This project details ability to webscrape, analsye, and manipulate data into legible formats, as well as use it in a variety of tools, which aid in comprehension of this data.
The partner I worked on in this assignment used the tools in this project to create and publish a website.
